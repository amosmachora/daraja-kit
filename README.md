- Open source!
- Slow integration. You don`t have to hot swap this library. You can easily integrate it to your app.
- More Util Functions. If you need to generate passwords if you have decided to slowly integrate the app offers helper functions to help you move along nicely. e.g generateTimestamp and generatePassword.

# Compatibility

Some APIs are exclusively for Node Environments and some are just React Components so are only used in react.
