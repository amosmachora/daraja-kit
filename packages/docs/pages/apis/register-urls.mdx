# RegisterURLS

You can use this api to register validation and confirmation URLs. You can read the official docs here. The gist is that the URLs you register will be used to confirm or validate a transaction each time it is executed.

You can use the `registerC2BUrl` function to make the request. It takes in an object as an argument of type `RegisterUrlBody` and returns a `RegisterUrlResponse`
