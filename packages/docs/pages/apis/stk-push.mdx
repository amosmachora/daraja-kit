# STK Push

The library exports a function `stkPushRequest` that takes an object as a parameter. the type of the object is STKPushRequestParam. You can use the type to provide you with intellisense as you build out the object.

Here is an example of how you can make a request in node .

```tsx copy
import { stkPushRequest, STKPushRequestParam } from "daraja-kit";

const myReqObj: STKPushRequestParam = {
  phoneNumber: "254719428019",
  amount: "100",
  callbackURL: "https://example.com/api/stk-push-callback",
  transactionDesc: "Payment for your service",
  accountReference: "user123@example.com",
};

const makeSTKPushRequest = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await stkPushRequest(myReqObj);
    console.log("STK Push Request Successful:", response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  }
};

makeSTKPushRequest();
```

The account reference param i have found to be required when using the api. If you don`t have an account reference or you don`t need it you might just include a random non-empty string.

## Callbacks

Daraja API sends the result of the STKPush Request after processing to the callback url you sent when making the request.

The library exports two types `STKPushSuccessfulCallbackBody` and `STKPushErrorCallbackBody` that you can use to when processing daraja responses. Here is an example of how you can use the types in NextJS

```tsx copy
import {
  STKPushErrorCallbackBody,
  STKPushSuccessfulCallbackBody,
} from "daraja-kit";
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

const POST = async (req: NextRequest, res: NextResponse) => {
  const receivedResponse:
    | STKPushSuccessfulCallbackBody
    | STKPushErrorCallbackBody = req.body;

  let successObj: STKPushSuccessfulCallbackBody;
  let errorObj: STKPushErrorCallbackBody;

  if (receivedResponse.Body.stkCallback.ResultCode === 0) {
    successObj = receivedResponse;
    //do something
  } else {
    errorObj = receivedResponse;
    //do something
  }
  //the below response doesn't matter but nextjs requires you to return something from Api route handlers
  return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
};
```
