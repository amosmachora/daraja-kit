# ReverseC2BTransaction

Reverses a C2B M-Pesa transaction. Once a customer pays and there is a need to reverse the transaction, the organization will use this API to reverse the amount. You can read the official docs [here](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/APIs/Reversal).

You can use the `reverseC2BTransaction` function to make the API call. It takes in an argument of type `ReverseC2BTransactionBody` and returns an awaitable promise of type `ReverseC2BTransactionResponse`
