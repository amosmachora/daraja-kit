# Tax Remittance

This API enables businesses to remit tax to Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA). To use this API, prior integration is required with KRA for tax declaration, payment registration number (PRN) generation, and exchange of other tax-related information. You can read the official docs [here](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/APIs/TaxRemittance).

You can use the `remitTax` function to make the api call. It takes in an argument of type `TaxRemittanceBody` and returns an awaitable promise of type `TaxRemittanceResponse`
