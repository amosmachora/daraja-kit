# B2B Express Checkout

This API enables you to pay bills directly from your business account to a pay bill number, or a paybill store. You can use this API to pay on behalf of a consumer/requester.

You can use the `b2bExpressCheckout` function to make that call. It takes an argument of type `B2BExpressCheckoutBody` and returns an awaitable promise of type unknown. I have not used this api extensively but i am working on finding out how it works in depth and update the return typings correctly.
