# Account balance

The Account Balance API is used to request the account balance of a short code. This can be used for both B2C, buy goods and pay bill accounts. Read the official docs [here.](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/APIs/Reversal)

You can use the `getAccountBalance` function to make the call. It takes an object of type `AccountBalanceBody` and returns an awaitable promise of type `AccountBalanceResponse`
